## Setup:


1. Install .NET6 (the build script might be doing it 
2. Install NodeJS
3. Run the build script in root, which will nuke and try to do a build.


Tech used:

- Vite for package management and maybe later some React pages;
- Tailwind for styling;
- [YARP](https://microsoft.github.io/reverse-proxy/index.html) to forward asset requests to the Vite server in development.
